#Simple ToDo (Learning Project)
A small project building while I go through FullStackOpen, goal of this project is to practice and internalize implemtation of react concepts I learn in each part.

## Purpose
- Learn React and full-stack concepts by building.
- Apply concepts from FullStackOpen incrementally.
- Avoid AI slop or too much reliance on it.
- Understand bugs, limitations, and design decisions through hands-on work.
